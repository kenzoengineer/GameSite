                    <p>
                        The origins of this game were simple. A group of wasps created a nest inside
                        the walls of my house. They were quiet, and nobody knew they were there until
                        they made their expedition outside of their hive. But being inside of a house
                        rather than the outdoors, they found themselves inside a room. <strong>My room.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The war on the wasps was one with heavy casualties. On the one side, the humans sustained no physical,
                        only mental damage. However, the wasp alliance had deaths in the hundreds. This is due to the humans'
                        use of Geneva Convention banned tools such as chemical weaponry. They may be tried for war crimes at a
                        later date. For now, the humans are finally at peace, but the kerfuffle spawned an idea into my head.
                        Lets make a game about murdering more wasps because they have not suffered enough. After all, it was <em>their</em>
                        fault they created their hive in my house. The humans were here 
                        <em>first</em>.

                            By utilising the full extent of Unity Engine's raytracing system in
                            combination with polished hitboxes, you will never feel like you missed
                            a shot you should have hit. The hitscan sniper rifle fires as soon as
                            you click without bullet travel time for the smooth firing action. A
                            tracer is shown for optimal visual feedback, immersing you further into the game.

                            To make for a challenging game, the enemies are coded using
                            A* pathfinding algorithms, allowing for accurate obstacle
                            avoidance as well as low processer resource usage. Difficult will
                            ramp up as time goes on, with enemies seemingly teaming up and
                            using strategy such as a mixture of ground and air forces. This
                            difficulty ramp up will make sure the player feels like they've
                            accompished something over time.

                            the open, but rewarding you with a strong buff, such as a shield, rapid
                            firing and much more. The handy arrow on your HUD will point you to where
                            the powerup spawns, but it's up to you to get there without sustaining damage.

                            Your bread and butter is their high powered sniper rifle. It
                            has a slow firing speed of once every 0.75 seconds, however, deals
                            massive damage to all enemies. Be careful, as it only has 7 bullets in a mag,
                            requiring the you to reload regularly. For support, you also have a teleporter
                            which can get you out of a pinch, which comes attached with a hefty
                            cooldown. When the going gets tough, you can always rely on your melee when
                            there are lots of enemies in front of you or your sniper has run dry.
